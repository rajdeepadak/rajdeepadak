Welcome to my Github page !

I am a researcher at the [Robotics and Dynamical Systems Group](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/rads/) at Arizona State university (ASU). I also mentor the [CFD-FOSSEE](https://cfd.fossee.in/home) GUI development team at IIT Bombay. My interests are in studying methods of optimal control in aero-hydrodynamically influenced systems. At ASU, I develop solutions for robotic automation processes and also study aerial robotics. I presently teach the RAS545 laboratory course at ASU. My research at IIT Bombay involves developing fluid-flow analysis tools that can be conveniently integrated with the workflow of control system design software and yield results for electro-mechanical design optimization. I am the primary author of [Venturial](https://github.com/FOSSEE/venturial) and [PyVNT](https://github.com/FOSSEE/pyvnt). I am captivated by policy based model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods that have the potential to capture non-linear dynamics.
